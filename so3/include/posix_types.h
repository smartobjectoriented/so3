 * This allows for 1024 file descriptors: if NR_OPEN is ever grown
 * beyond that you'll have to change this too. But 1024 fd's seem to be
 * enough even for such "real" unices like OSF/1, so hopefully this is
 * one limit that doesn't have to be changed [again].
 *
 * Note that POSIX wants the FD_CLEAR(fd,fdsetp) defines to be in
 * <sys/time.h> (and thus <linux/time.h>) - but this is a more logical
 * place for them. Solved by having dummy defines in <sys/time.h>.
